Part 1

11.3  activity 5 for parsing the website and finding the text. For the loops I also used 11.3 activity 4 that was very similar. That seemed to let me complete the first part of this activity, along with a few things we have already done in previous homework's (like creating a list).

Part 2

Seems to be the same thing at the beginning so I just looked at part 1.To create the dataframe is from 11.3 activity 4 as well. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html for converting the data types. The next bit was just doing groupby with what item we wanted and how we wanted it ordered. The last bit was just making graphs which we have done multiple times in this course so I just looked at my code from previous homework/group projects.
